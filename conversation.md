Chat:I've modified the erase button so that when clicked, it removes all previous brush strokes while maintaining the background color. Let me know if you need any further refinements!

N:That ruined the canvas and drawing aspect, can you replace what you changed and reimplement the erase button. I want it to work like the drawing tool, but taking the brush strokes away in the area of the crosshair

N:can you make it so the selection makes a rectangle around what I'm selecting and I can see what I am selecting before releasing. Have it size from the initial click to when it gets released 

Chat:I've updated the selection feature so that when selecting an area, a red dashed rectangle is drawn dynamically from the initial click to the mouse release. Let me know if you need any further refinements!

N: the select tool doesn't work properly. I wanted the rectangle to stretch over any of the drawing, so that I can make a selection of what is in the rectangle and then move it around the screen
