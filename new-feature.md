I added the erase tool and the selection tool to select an area of drawing and move it around. This is reasonable because moving something or erasing are both very useful tools, especially when working in something like photoshop or other drawing canvases. The erase tool is supposed to replace the pen tool, but rather taking away brush strokes rather than adding them. The selection tool is a rectangle that the user draws over a certain part of their canvas which can "select" and move once the seleciton is made via a simple drag technique. The erase tool twice broke the canvas drawing element, but then fixed it once iterated upon. However, the selection tool was more difficult, it made a rectangle tool the first time, the second time it couldn't make the rectangle by the description I gave. Then after that it broke the drawing part of the canvas. Then finally it got a sort-of working version.
